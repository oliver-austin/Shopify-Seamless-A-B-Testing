## Unreleased

## v3.0.0 - 2019-03-06

### Breaking Changes

- Export icons as React Components built using [SVGR](https://www.smooth-code.com/open-source/svgr/) instead of a bespoke object format.
- Export names are now PascalCase instead of camelCase to denote that they are React Components. For example: `addMinor` is now `AddMinor`
- Major icon exports are now suffixed with their “style” - either “Monotone” to “Twotone”. For example: `ordersMajor` is now `ordersMajorTwotone`.
- Several icons have been renamed so that their export name matches their name in Abstract to ensure we have a common language between designers and developers. See [#203](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-icons/pull/203), [#215](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-icons/pull/215), [#195](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-icons/pull/195), [#182](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-icons/pull/182), [#183](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-icons/pull/183) and [#184](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-icons/pull/184).

### Enhancements

- Added several new icons from the online-store-web project.

## v2.0.0 - 2019-02-06

### Breaking Changes

- Export icons individually in order to enable tree shaking.
- Icon exports are now suffixed with their type (`Major` or `Minor`). This allows for a future where the same concept has both a major and minor icon. It also avoids inconsistencies to work around cases where icons names clashed with JS reserved keywords (e.g. delete, import and export).
- Removed the `ellipsis` icon as has been deprecated in favor of the `horizontalDots` icon. The icons are visually identical so this is a straight replacement.

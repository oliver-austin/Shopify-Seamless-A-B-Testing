Most commonly\r\n * it's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of a component, but can also\r\n * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.\r\n *\r\n * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the\r\n * component it renders, it only tracks \"enter\" and \"exit\" states for the components.\r\n * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can\r\n * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:\r\n *\r\n * ```jsx\r\n * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';\r\n *\r\n * const duration = 300;\r\n *\r\n * const defaultStyle = {\r\n *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,\r\n *   opacity: 0,\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * const transitionStyles = {\r\n *   entering: { opacity: 0 },\r\n *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },\r\n * };\r\n *\r\n * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (\r\n *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>\r\n *     {(state) => (\r\n *       <div style={{\r\n *         ...defaultStyle,\r\n *         ...transitionStyles[state]\r\n *       }}>\r\n *         I'm a fade Transition!\r\n *       </div>\r\n *     )}\r\n *   </Transition>\r\n * );\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * As noted the `Transition` component doesn't _do_ anything by itself to its child component.\r\n * What it does do is track transition states over time so you can update the\r\n * component (such as by adding styles or classes) when it changes states.\r\n *\r\n * There are 4 main states a Transition can be in:\r\n *  - `'entering'`\r\n *  - `'entered'`\r\n *  - `'exiting'`\r\n *  - `'exited'`\r\n *\r\n * Transition state is toggled via the `in` prop. When `true` the component begins the\r\n * \"Enter\" stage. During this stage, the component will shift from its current transition state,\r\n * to `'entering'` for the duration of the transition and then to the `'entered'` stage once\r\n * it's complete. Let's take the following example:\r\n *\r\n * ```jsx\r\n * state = { in: false };\r\n *\r\n * toggleEnterState = () => {\r\n *   this.setState({ in: true });\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * render() {\r\n *   return (\r\n *     <div>\r\n *       <Transition in={this.state.in} timeout={500} />\r\n *       <button onClick={this.toggleEnterState}>Click to Enter</button>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   );\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * When the button is clicked the component will shift to the `'entering'` state and\r\n * stay there for 500ms (the value of `timeout`) before it finally switches to `'entered'`.\r\n *\r\n * When `in` is `false` the same thing happens except the state moves from `'exiting'` to `'exited'`.\r\n *\r\n * ## Timing\r\n *\r\n * Timing is often the trickiest part of animation, mistakes can result in slight delays\r\n * that are hard to pin down. A common example is when you want to add an exit transition,\r\n * you should set the desired final styles when the state is `'exiting'`. That's when the\r\n * transition to those styles will start and, if you matched the `timeout` prop with the\r\n * CSS Transition duration, it will end exactly when the state changes to `'exited'`.\r\n *\r\n * > **Note**: For simpler transitions the `Transition` component might be enough, but\r\n * > take into account that it's platform-agnostic, while the `CSSTransition` component\r\n * > [forces reflows](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/blob/5007303e729a74be66a21c3e2205e4916821524b/src/CSSTransition.js#L208-L215)\r\n * > in order to make more complex transitions more predictable.
